# Healthcare-Appointment-ChatBot
INTRODUCTION

The hospital management program is a
combination of codes which allows
patients to enter their personal and
medical credentials such as name, age,
allergies, medical history etc. and then
receive information about their doctor and
a summary of the information. This is a
python program that emulates a chatbot to
perform the function of a appointment
token system. A supplemental website
was also created called “Cleveland’s
Healthcare” which can be accessed online
and which will be shown in the later pages
and this website helps patients with the
entire contactless appointment system


along with the python based code. This is
an effective and efficient code which
allows doctors and other hospital staffs to
save their time, as this chat-bot will ease
their job, hence making the whole
management system in the hospital better.
Many coding programs are used to build
this code. A lot of time and effort has been
put into this as in the health industry, time
is priceless, and using technology we can
save time and indirectly saving people’s
lives, which is why a project on “hospital
management system” was taken in the
first place.


Overview of This Project
1. This Hospital Management System
was created as a response to the
ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic.
2. This project helps in successfully
carrying out contactless medical
diagnosis in such difficult times.
3. Contactless Medical Diagnosis
would be carried out in the following
steps-
-Run the python program, reply to
the instructions of the chatbot.
- A summary of the replies by the
patient will be displayed at the end of
the chatbot and the next patient will
be called.


-The summary of the patient’s
responses shall be sent to the
assigned doctor.
-All this data will be stored in a
MySQL database where it can be
extracted again should the patient
return for a second diagnosis.

OR
-Go to clevelandshealthcare.com
-Click on the appointments tab
present on the home page of the
website.
-opt for either in-person
appointment using a simple form or
for the contactless option.
-A python command prompt will be
displayed in the contactless

appointment section, where a
chatbot will ask you questions.
-By answering those questions,
information will be gathered on the
patients and the chatbot will
allocate the best suited specialist
doctor for the patient.
-The chatbot requires information
on the medical history, allergies,
name, etc and acts as a qualified
receptionist.
-There is a doctors section where
the doctor can access the
appointments made to him along
with a look at the responses of the
patient to the chat bot.


Objectives of the Project
1. This project aims at the creation and
implementation of a new contactless
mode of medical diagnosis
2. This project aims to provide a
smooth contactless process of
medical diagnosis amidst this
pandemic.
3. This project aims to provide a
healthier and risk-free medical
healthcare system

What is the need for this
project?
1. This project came into existence in
order to solve a problem which was
affecting people all around the world.
2. This problem is the worldwide
pandemic preventing people from
getting risk-free and safe healthcare,
which has been a key factor in
creating more issues and health
implications.
3. In order to combat this problem, a
new model of healthcare, known as
contactless healthcare was
developed with the help of python
and MySQL, as well as a


supplemental fully responsive
website.
4. The need for safe and risk-free
healthcare was imminent, and with
the help of this project, the issue has
been addressed and the need of this
project has been clearly understood.

User Manual

Case-1: Using Python as a medium for
Chatbot

chatbot
Step-2: Provide accurate information to
the chatbot, the same will be displayed to
the doctor.
Step-3: Specify the type of consultation
Step-4: A doctor has been assigned.
Case-2: Using the website as the
medium for Chatbot
Step-1: Start your preferred web browser


Step-2: Search
www.clevelandshealthcare.com
Step-3: Click on the appointments tab
Step-4: Scroll to the contactless
appointment python command prompt
running on the website
Step-5: Follow the instructions as directed
by the chat bot.
Step-6: A doctors appointment has been
setup.

CONCLUSION

This code initially takes in input from the users
starting from the personal information and
leading to the medical history. The hospital
already has some doctors , who are
specialized in various fields. These doctors are
then assigned to these patients with no delay
and a summary of the responses will be given
to both parties. This code is highly useful as it
even removes the need of a receptionist of
trying to get information one by one as over
here, all the details entered will be done and
processed faster.
